 - Worked on Unacademy's learner experience pod and built some major features such as Device Limitation (restricting the parallel content consumption on the same subscription accounts), Groups (Social Media for learners), Planner, Epub Notes, Syllabus, Streaks etc.
 - Worked on tech performance charter for the organisation such as migrating pages from redux to Zustand and SWR which resulted in reducing page size to about ~500kb per visit, converting pages to static pages, enabling CDN caching for static pages and reducing page doc load time.
 - Built architecture and POC for new projects which included crucial decisions like suitable library selection, cross pod collaborations, streamlining estimation, development and QA cycle.
